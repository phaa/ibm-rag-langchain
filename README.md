## About the Course

This is an **intermediate-level**, approximately 7–8 hour course that teaches how to design and build AI agents using **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **LangChain**.

What you'll learn:

- Principles and workflow of RAG: dense retrieval (DPR), encoders, tokenizers, FAISS, and model integration (Hugging Face + PyTorch)
- In-context learning and advanced prompt engineering techniques, including templates and example selectors
- LangChain fundamentals: tools, document loaders, retrievers, chains, agents, and in‑context parsing   
- Integration: building interactive AI agents that combine RAG and LangChain components  
- Hands-on real-world project labs to consolidate knowledge and build portfolio-ready demos

- **Jupyter Notebooks**

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phaa/ibm-rag-langchain.git
cd ibm-rag-langchain/
```

2. Activate the virtual environment (conda or venv):
   ```bash
   conda activate ibmenv
   ```
3. Run the notebooks in Jupyter lab:  
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
*Each notebook has a cell to install the necessary dependencies.*
